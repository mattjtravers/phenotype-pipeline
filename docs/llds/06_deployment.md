# Deployment

## Context and Design Philosophy

This component owns all AWS infrastructure concerns: S3 bucket structure, SageMaker training job configuration, Lambda inference wrapper, and IAM policies.

The two AWS execution environments have distinct roles:
- **SageMaker Training Job** — canonical environment for training; runs `pipeline/train.py` in a custom container
- **Lambda** — inference only; loads the trained model artifact from S3 and serves predictions

The deployment layer is a thin wrapper. It does not contain ML logic. It adapts the pipeline's interfaces to these two AWS execution environments.

## S3 Bucket Structure

All pipeline data lives under a single S3 bucket (name configurable via environment variable `PHENO_S3_BUCKET`):

```
s3://{bucket}/
  data/
    raw/          ← downloaded 1000 Genomes VCF files and sample metadata
  models/
    {run_id}/
      model.json
      feature_registry.json
      imputation_medians.json
      evaluation_report.json
      label_encoder.json
  logs/
    training/
    inference/
```

`run_id` is a timestamp + short UUID (e.g., `20240115-a3f2c1`). This enables multiple model versions to coexist without overwriting.

## SageMaker Training Job

Training runs as a SageMaker Training Job using a custom Docker container (built from the project's `Dockerfile`). The container entry point calls `pipeline/train.py`.

Key configuration:
- **Instance type**: `ml.m5.2xlarge` (8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) — sufficient for 1000 Genomes scale
- **Input channels**: S3 URIs for raw data and (optionally) cached processed data
- **Output path**: S3 model artifact path
- **Environment variables**: pipeline parameters (k-fold k, MAF threshold, N markers, etc.)

SageMaker is used for training only. Inference runs in Lambda (see below).

## Lambda Execution

The prediction component runs as a Lambda function:
- **Runtime**: Python 3.12 (container image Lambda to include XGBoost)
- **Trigger**: API Gateway (REST endpoint) or S3 event (batch mode)
- **Memory**: 3008 MB (XGBoost model loading requires headroom)
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds
- **Environment variables**: `PHENO_S3_BUCKET`, `MODEL_RUN_ID`

The pipeline trains exactly one model. The Lambda handler loads the model artifact from the S3 path identified by the `MODEL_RUN_ID` environment variable, set once at deploy time. The artifact is cached in `/tmp` on cold start and reused for warm invocations. No model selection logic is needed.

### API routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/predict` | Runs inference on a single-sample VCF; returns a `PredictionResult` JSON body |
| `GET`  | `/labels`  | Returns the deployed model's phenotype label list as JSON `{"labels": [...]}` |

The `/labels` endpoint reads `label_encoder.json` from the cached artifact (or loads the artifact if cold). It exists so the Streamlit UI can populate its phenotype dropdown from the deployed model without hardcoding labels in the UI image. The response is the sorted list of label strings (the integer keys are an internal detail of training and are not exposed).

## IAM Policies

Two roles:

**SageMaker Training Role**
- `s3:GetObject` on `s3://1000genomes/*` (public bucket)
- `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject` on `s3://{bucket}/*`
- `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:PutLogEvents`

**Lambda Execution Role**
- `s3:GetObject` on `s3://{bucket}/models/*`
- `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:PutLogEvents`

## Decisions & Alternatives

| Decision | Chosen | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Training execution | SageMaker Training Job | SageMaker Pipelines, EC2, local only | Training Jobs are the simplest managed compute option; Pipelines adds orchestration complexity unnecessary for a demo |
| Inference execution | Lambda (container image) | SageMaker endpoint, ECS | Lambda is serverless and cost-effective for low-frequency demo predictions; SageMaker endpoint is always-on and expensive |
| Local dev S3 | Local filesystem via `PHENO_LOCAL_DATA_DIR` env var | LocalStack, moto mocking | Filesystem adapter is simple and transparent; LocalStack/moto add unnecessary dependencies for a demo |
| Run ID format | Timestamp + UUID | Incrementing integer, git SHA | Timestamps sort naturally; UUIDs prevent collisions; git SHA would require a git context in SageMaker |

## Open Questions & Future Decisions

### Resolved
1. ✅ SageMaker Training Job for training, Lambda for inference — one process per component, no dual-mode switching
2. ✅ Lambda chosen over SageMaker endpoint for inference (serverless, cost-effective for low-frequency demo use)
3. ✅ Single training run; model version is fixed at deploy time via `MODEL_RUN_ID` — no model selection UI or versioning logic needed

### Deferred
1. API Gateway authentication (API key vs Cognito) — out of scope for SDD demo
2. CI/CD pipeline for container image builds and SageMaker job triggers
